# Fitting-A-Regression-Line-in-Python
given dataset and plots, I try to fit a Regression line using Python programming

### For Carats case:
The OLS Regression Results shows us that:
For every 0.01 carat increase in the car size, we can expect the price to increase by 37.21 dollars
97.8% of the variability in price is up to the diamond size
